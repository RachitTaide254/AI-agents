Subject: Half-Day Leave Application for 28th June 2025

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request a half-day leave on 28th June 2025, specifically for the second half of the day. The reason for this request is that I have an exam scheduled in the afternoon.

I assure you that I will ensure all my responsibilities are taken care of before I leave, and I will coordinate with my team to ensure that my absence does not affect our project deadlines.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Best regards,
Rachit Taide
