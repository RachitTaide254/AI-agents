# ðŸ§  AI Agents from Scratch to Advanced

A hands-on journey to building **autonomous AI agents** using **LangGraph**, **LangChain Tools**, and the **ReAct pattern** â€” starting from simple agents to advanced, multi-step reasoning systems.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project explores the complete lifecycle of building AI agents using:
- ðŸ”„ **LangGraph** â€“ for building stateful, multi-step, dynamic workflows
- ðŸ§° **LangChain Tools** â€“ for enabling external function/tool usage
- ðŸ§  **ReAct Pattern** â€“ combining reasoning + action for intelligent behavior
